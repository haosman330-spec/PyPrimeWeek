    "# String Methods\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quaotation marks, `\"\"` or `''`. Strings are represented in Python as a string object. String objects have their own set of built-in methods that can be used to manipulate the string. To use a string method, you simply add a `.` after a string literal or a string variable followed by the required function. We have already seen an example of this in Unit 1 using the `format()` method, e.g. `\"My name is {0}\".format(\"Dave\")`."

Postive `n` values indicate printing should begin at the start of the file while negative `n` values indicate printing should begin at the end of the file. A sample file `data/sample1.txt` has been provided for this exercise. Use your function to print the first 3 and last 3 lines.\n",

One of the earliest forms of cipher used by Julius Caesar in Roman times involves shifting letters a given number of positions in the alphabet (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). For example, assuming the shift value is 3, then all occurrences of the letter `A` in a text are substituted with the letter `D`, `B` with `E` and so on. Write a Python program that uses this technique to encrypt a given file `data/sample3.txt` using the shift value 12 and write the result into a new file `data/sample3_shifted.txt`. Assume that only capital letters are used and other character should be passed through unchanged (such as a space or a full stop).\n",
    "4. Create a new solution (based on your solution to 3. above) to decrypt the file `data/sample4_shifted.txt` and write the result into a new file `data/sample4.txt` assuming the shift value used was 4. NOTE: you will need to shift the letters in the other direction."

    "It is possible to use the `raise` keyword without any exception included. In this situation, we are re-raising a previous exception. It is common to do this in an `except` clause. This causes the exception to be passed back to the calling function. If that function has its own try..except code blocks the exception can be dealt with again. This can be useful to help track down issues within your Python code where information can be added to the console output at each step of the algorithm. The following example illustrates this:"

    "## Defining Custom Exceptions\n",
    "Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class. Exceptions should typically be derived from the base class `Exception`, either directly or indirectly. Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, but are usually kept simple. This definition of a custom exception uses class inheritance. In other words, your new custom exception is defined a special kind of existing exception. The following example illustartes how to create and use a custom exception called `MySpecialError` which is derived from the Base class `Exception`:"
