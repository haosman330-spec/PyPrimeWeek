    "## Goals\n",
    "Unit 4 focuses on building algorithmic solutions to programming problems and introduces functions as a solution to help with this process. Units 1-3 introduced the fundamental features of the Python programming language and focused very much on practical experience of using these features. This week we will bring these features together to start solving realistic and relevant programming problems.\n",

    "### Problem Solving\n",
    "Structured programming is a method of programming designed to help make large programs easier to read. It is aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs. Python programs are composed of one or more of the following structures: Sequences, Selection and Iteration. Sequences are simply a group of python statements which are executed in sequence. Selections are choices that can be added to a program to execute sequences dependent upon some condition, e.g. if x = 5 then perform sequence A otherwise perform sequence B. Finally, iterations are sequences of statements that are repeated multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind structured programming is to divide and conquer. As computers, technology, and software have advanced, programs have become larger and more difficult to write and maintain. Structured programming breaks down complex programs into simple tasks. The rule of thumb is that if a task is too complex to be described simply, then the task needs to be broken down further. When the task is small enough to be self contained and easily understood , then the task can be programmed. Structured programming gave rise to a number of other movements, Object-Oriented Programming being one of the more important ones."

    "### Functions\n",
    "A function is a self-contained sequence of program statements that accomplishes a specific task. Functions help to give structure to your programs and promote code re-use. Functions can accept data when called (parameters) and give data back to the calling code (return) if required. Functions should use a name that helps a developer to understand what the functions task is. To call a function, you simple use its name, followed by `()` brackets with any parameters included inside the brackets in a comma-separated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining a function\n",
    "In the following example, we build on the Fibonacci sequence we learnt about in week 3. A function is defined which prints all of the Fibonacci series numbers up to the given parameter value `n`. NOTE: in Python the function definition must be executed before it can be used. Comments have been added to every line of the function definition to help you to follow the algorithm and function construction."
